# Task 2: Text Summarization

## Objective
Create a system that summarizes lengthy articles, blogs, or news into concise summaries.

## Dataset
CNN/Daily Mail Dataset

## Key Steps
- Preprocess textual data.
- Implement extractive summarization using spaCy.
- Implement abstractive summarization using pre-trained models (BERT, GPT) with HuggingFace.
- Fine-tune models to improve summary quality.
- Evaluate coherence on real-world articles.

## Outcome
A summarization model generating concise summaries from long texts.
