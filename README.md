# Task 3: Disease Diagnosis Prediction

## Objective
Build a model to predict the likelihood of diseases such as diabetes or heart disease from medical data.

## Dataset
PIMA Diabetes Dataset or Heart Disease Dataset

## Key Steps
- Perform EDA to explore feature relationships.
- Apply feature selection and scale data.
- Train models such as Gradient Boosting, SVM, Neural Networks.
- Evaluate with F1 Score and AUC-ROC.
- Provide actionable healthcare insights.

## Outcome
A prediction model offering early disease detection and prevention insights.
